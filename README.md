# Portfolio

Using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS I build this website to try web design. I always been intrigued by idea of web design and this project gave me a better appreciation for how websites are made. This is my first website I have ever built. Especially ones that make you go "Wow, this website looks pretty cool!" I had a lot of fun and a lot of trial and error. This website is hosted through GitHub pages. If you have any suggestions on how I can improve it, feel free to let me know!
